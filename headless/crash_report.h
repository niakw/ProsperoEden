// When the app crashes: a report in the logs folder, then the app starts again and the launcher
// says where the report is.
//
// A fatal signal (a bad memory access, an illegal instruction, abort) reaches a handler that
// writes logs/crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt: what failed and where, the registers, the app's code
// addresses found on the stack (the calls that led there), the thread, what was running and the
// memory left. It uses system calls and its own buffers only: the heap and the C library's
// streams may be what broke. A thread that has waited since startup then starts the app again
// (src/lifecycle.c). When that does not happen within a few seconds the signal takes its usual
// course, and the system handles the crash as it did before this existed.
//
// The report holds addresses, never memory contents. tools/symbolize-crash.py turns them into
// function names with the build's llvm-pie.elf.
//
// Not covered: a crash before Install, and a stack overflow (the handler needs the thread's own
// stack). Those end as before.
